This work is completed as an assignment for a coding bootcamp.

In this project, we are given working code for a website.  However, the code is not optimal and does not use semantic tags for accessibility.  As such, the goal was to refactor the code to work more optimally.  The deployed website is [here](https://jalbert12485.github.io/refactor/) and a screenshot is below.
